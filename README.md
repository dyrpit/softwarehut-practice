# Zonifero - SoftwareHut Pracitce

Site built during my practice in SoftwareHut as a first task. Project was based on the graphic design of Zonifero website. The task was to recreate that design as a interactive website, as close to the original but without using JS (only HTML and CSS). The purpose of this project was to sharpen making layouts skills, using only CSS and BEM convention.
